### set up:

1. open terminal
2. navigate to the path `~/ga` (cd ga)
3. create a new directory called `simpsons` (mkdir simpsons)
4. create a directory called `springfield` and 'cd' into it (cd simpsons, mkdir springfield, cd springfield)
5. create the following files in your `springfield` folder (touch {homer,marge,bart,lisa,maggie}.txt)

### remaking the intro:

1a. create a directory called `school` (mkdir school)
1b. move `bart.txt`(mv bart.txt school)

2a. create a directory `power-plant` (mkdir power-plant)
2b. move `homer.txt` into it (mv homer.txt power-plant)

4b. move marge and maggie inside it (mv marge.txt market then mv maggie.txt market)

5a. traverse to the `school` directory (cd school)
5b. create a `band-room` directory (mkdir band-room)
5c. move `lisa.txt` into the `band-room` directory (cd ../.. then mv lisa.txt school then cd school then mv lisa.txt band-room)

6a. traverse back to the `springfield` directory (cd ../)
6b. create the directories for the each mode of transportation (mkdir pink-car then mkdir red-car then mkdir skateboard)
6c. place each respective party in that directory
    --> marge & maggie: cd market then mv *.txt ../red-car
    --> homer: cd power-plant then mv homer.txt ../pink-car
    --> bart: cd school mv bart.txt ../skateboard

7a. create a `home` directory inside of `springfield` (mkdir home)
7b. create a `couch` directory within `home` (cd home then mkdir couch then cd couch then in couch pwd (then copy it for 7b))
7c. move ALL of the family members to `couch` (cd ../.. then mv pink-car/*.txt red-car/*.txt skateboard/*.txt home/couch/)
