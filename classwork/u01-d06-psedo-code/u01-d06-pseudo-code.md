#Pseudo Code Practice:


"leverage the machine to do work for us"

##Thinking Steps (one single problem at a time)

-Identify the problem
-Conceptualize the problem (this is the perfect time to use an analogy)
-Break down the problem
-Start small

###Option 1: A Trivia Game


Instructions: The game should have a preset list of questions, which are shown one at a time to the user. The user submits their answer and goes to the next question. After each question they can see whether they were correct or incorrect. They can also see their total score.


1. Create a list of saved pre-set questions with accompanied answers (numbered list)

2. Loop through the list one at a time, starting at the first 

3. Display the currently looped question

4. Prompt user to submit an answer

5. Listen for the user to submit answer

6. check to see if the answer the user submitted is the same as the pre-set answer for that question

7. If the answer answer is the same as the pre-set display "correct" and add one to the score-board (created here)

8. Else, display "inccorect" and don't change the score

9. Display the score 

10. Go to the next question in the loop

11. After loop is finished, display the final score
